# Modified-Horiseon-Demo-page

## Introduction and Objectives
This project was done to better understant how to format a html index file using the proper semantics. 
The use of the semantics provides better user experience,
allows better navigation and,
allows for optimisation of search engine advertisement.

## challanges
I have tried to use as much semantics as i possibly could, however, i still missed the asside semantics.
I encountered two major challanges thorughout this project. The first was after i had modified the header to include the "nav" semantics. This resulted in a loss of the formating for the web page. After extensive research i realised that i had to target the new semantic in the CSS style sheet to reinstate its formatting and styling.

The second challenge i encounterd was while using the footer semantic. i had not included the class attribute for the footer resulting in a loss of formating. However, this problem was rectified with help from my tutor.
